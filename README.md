# Coronavirus
Analysis on the data on the novel coronavirus from worldometers. Continually updated.

## How to run
1. Run the 'Get data' file first, entering in each country you want to analyse and re-running the script. In order for the graphs in the analysis file to work, at least Germany, France, Spain, Italy, US, UK, Australia, Canada, Norway, Iran and South-Korea must be run.
2. Run the 'Create dfs' file to readjust the data from country based dataframes to case or death based over time.
3. Run any of the other files to see the results!

## Important
Before committing and pushing your changes, clear all output from all the scripts by going 'Cell->All Output->Clear All'.
